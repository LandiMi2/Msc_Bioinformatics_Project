IgDiscover test data set
========================

This dataset is a subset of the human Ig heavy chain dataset ERR1760498
available on the Sequence Read Archive. Only reads coming from a couple of
highly expressed genes were chosen to make sure that they pass the filters for
discover even though the dataset itself is small.

The dataset is mainly for testing whether IgDiscover was correctly installed, so
not much is really “discovered”.

Also, since it appears that re-distributing the IMGT human IGH database is not
legal, a database of lower quality is included that was created from Ensembl
annotations.

See <https://bitbucket.org/igdiscover/testdata/> for the scripts that were
used to create the dataset.

Instructions for how to run IgDiscover on this dataset are available at
<http://docs.igdiscover.se/en/latest/testing.html>.
